Welcome to the example page.

This markdown supports html elements like the `p` tag coupled with inline styles

<p style="color: #ff7340; border: 1px solid rgba(255, 135, 23, 0.25); border-radius:5px; padding: 1rem;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.</p>

Even satire code snippets with syntax highlighting are also supported. ðŸ˜…

```js
const lang = prompt("What is your favorite programming language?");

(lang === "JavaScript") | (lang === "javascript") | (lang === "js")
  ? alert("JavaScript to the world! ðŸš€ðŸŸ¡")
  : alert(`We don't permit such languages here ðŸ’©`);
```

Of course, images are not left out.
